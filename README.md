## The Tacoma Narrows Bridge: About The Project
A comprehensive analysis implementing the McKenna and Tuama (2001) mathematical model to study the catastrophic collapse of the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. This project focuses on simulating and analyzing how torsional oscillations were magnified by vertical forcing, leading to the bridge's failure.

### The Historical Context
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, opened in July 1940, collapsed just four months later due to wind-induced aeroelastic flutter. This project examines the engineering principles behind this famous structural failure through mathematical modeling and numerical analysis.

## Project Overview

This project implements and analyzes the McKenna and Tuama (2001) mathematical model of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge incident, focusing on how torsional oscillations can be magnified by vertical forcing.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Key Features

- Implementation of multiple numerical solvers:
  - Euler's Method
  - Trapezoid Method
  - Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) Method
- Convergence rate analysis
- Wind speed impact simulation
- Bridge oscillation visualization
- Minimum wind speed calculation using bisection method

## Project Activities

1. Stability analysis at wind speed W = 80 km/hr
2. Comparative analysis of Trapezoid and RK4 methods
3. Magnification factor calculation for small initial angles
4. Critical wind speed determination
5. Analysis of extreme conditions
6. Impact of damping coefficient

## Key Findings

- RK4 method proved more accurate than the Trapezoid method
- Critical wind speed of approximately 59.01 km/hr (using RK4)
- Doubling the damping coefficient increased wind resistance from 59.01 to 105.62 km/hr
- Structure showed instability at higher wind speeds even with small initial angles

## üåä The Perfect Storm: Nature Meets Engineering

On November 7, 1940, the world witnessed one of the most dramatic engineering failures in history. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, nicknamed "Galloping Gertie," transformed from a marvel of modern engineering into a cautionary tale about the power of resonance and aeroelastic flutter.

### üìä Project Scope
This analysis implements the McKenna-Tuama (2001) mathematical model to:
- Simulate wind-induced oscillations
- Calculate critical failure points
- Visualize the bridge's behavior under various conditions

        k1 = f(t[i-1], y[i-1])
        k2 = f(t[i-1] + h/2, y[i-1] + k1*h/2)
        k3 = f(t[i-1] + h/2, y[i-1] + k2*h/2)
        k4 = f(t[i-1] + h, y[i-1] + k3*h)
